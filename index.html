                This dish is a great example of <em>throw everything in the pan and add some garlic,</em> which really is the best way to prepare any meal. It got its name from where I bought a lot of these ingredients: the <strong class="Woodstock-Market">Woodstock Farmer’s Market</strong> in Woodstock, Illinois, which supplies its visitors with fresh, home-grown fruits, vegetables, pastries, and everything in-between from the farmers and producers themselves. You do not, of course, need to visit Woodstock to make this dish, but I always encourage the support of your local farm or market – if you are able to buy your ingredients at one of those, please do. <em>Recipe written and coded by Molly McCafferty in September 2021.</em>

            <p class="subheading">The Rice</p>
        
            <div class="text_body">
                <p> I like to prepare my rice beforehand since I am a poor multitasker when it comes to cooking, but feel free to save time and do everything at once.
                <ol>
                    <li>In a 5 quart pot, bring 4 cups of water to a steady boil and pour in 4 cups of rice.</li>
                    <br><li>Stir until the rice has been thoroughly drenched. Follow any additional instructions on your package or box of rice.</li>
                    <br><li>When it has finished cooking, throw black pepper and 2-3 pads of butter into that pot and stir. Let sit while you prepare the other ingredients.</li>
                </ol>
                </p>
            </div>

            <p class="subheading">The Good Stuff</p>
            <div class="text_body">
                <ol>
                    <li>In a medium to large pan and over medium-low heat, add 1 pad of butter and garlic until you, and potentially your neighbors, can smell the garlic cooking.</li>
                    <br><li>On medium heat, add the jalapeño peppers and mushrooms.</li>
                    <br><li>Let cook, stirring occasionally. When the mushrooms begin to brown and the peppers are aromatic, add the chicken.</li>
                    <br><li>Make sure you are using <em>cooked</em> chicken, and if previously frozen, make sure it has been defrosted. It can still be cold, but should not be iced over.</li>
                    <br><li>Let the chicken cook for 1.5 minutes or until relatively tender.</li>
                    <br><li>Over medium-low heat, add soy sauce and stir until everything in the pot has been coated. Adjust heat as necessary depending on how cooked the chicken pieces are.</li>
                    <br><li>Add spinach last, and let it cook down until small and dark.</li>
                    <br><li>Stir together until everything appears to be well-cooked and tender.</li>
                    <br><li>Add your jalapeño salt. If you kept the seeds with your peppers, go easy on the salt. If not, go nuts until you reach your spice tolerance level.</li>
                    <br><li>Let sit for 3 to 5 minutes, and pour into a serving dish or keep in the pan. Whichever is more your style.</li>
                    <br><li>Have handy your pot of rice, give everything a healthy stir, and serve.</li>
                    <br><li>3 large spoonfuls of rice to 2 good spoonfuls of chicken is a good proportion.</li>
                    <br><li>Serves 3 people, with leftover rice. Enjoy!</li>
